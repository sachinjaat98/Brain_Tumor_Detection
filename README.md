A brain tumor is a disease caused by the growth of abnormal brain cells. Due to their rarity and variety in appearance, tumors often have a tough time predicting a patient's survival rate. These tumors can be identified through Magnetic Resonance (MRI) Images, which plays an essential role in determining the tumor site; however, manual detection is a time-consuming and difficult process that can cause some errors in results. In order to effectively categorize and detect brain tumor photos, our suggested layers are applied to a deep convolutions neural network (CNN) MobileNetv2 base model. To improve the quality of the images, several filters are applied using image enhancement techniques. In order to improve the training of our suggested model, data augmentation techniques are used to expand the data samples. The findings demonstrate that the suggested optimized state-of-the-art MobileNet performs better than other CNN models, outperforming them in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the curve, with an overall classification and detection accuracy of 99%.
